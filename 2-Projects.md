I currently work at Springfield High school. It is school located on Springfield, Oregon.
I am Bilingual Educational Assistant. I basically teach students that have as primary language Spanish. The majority comes from Central America and Mexico and mostly speak Spanish and some speak native languages like Nautl, Cohbal and others.  It is a very diverse student population some have education and some don't have kind of education.
Mostly are migrants and refugees.
