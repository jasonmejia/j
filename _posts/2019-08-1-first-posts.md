**Summer Migrant Program July 2019 Oregon**

The last weeks of the whole month I worked at the Summer Migrant Program here in Lane County.
The program it was created for children from migrant families attend school and be in school.
They are children from seasonal workers that labor on the field of Oregon. So in order to keep them learning and in the school the program offers summer classes, that are continuation of their school and also to be ready for the next level in their education.
My class was comprised of 7th to 8th graders students from different ages. From 14 to 17.
During the summer we had 6th graders visit us for a group activity. My students from 7th and 8th graders became mentors for the 6th graders by helping them in class activities.
