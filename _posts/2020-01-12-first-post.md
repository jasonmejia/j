This is it!
What a wonderful post!
I currently work at Springfield High school. It is school located on Springfield, Oregon.
I am Bilingual Educational Assistant. I basically teach students that have as primary language Spanish. The majority comes from Central America and Mexico and mostly speak Spanish and some speak native languages like Nautl, Cohbal and others.  It is a very diverse student population some have education and some don't have kind of education.
Mostly are migrants and refugees.
I teach and tutor them mostly with science subjects, principally math, biology and physics. I also teach technical drawing and support in music classes. I also hold office hours to help them with class homework or school work.
During the class lecture that I attend with them I help closely and support them by explaining the class in Spanish. I review their work and help organize their studies and translate class contents in Spanish. Not only but I function as personal mentor and tutor.
My background is in science and I worked in university and colleges mostly in graduate research and teaching undergrad students. So the experience in teaching in high school it is a really great and interesting experience because I am perfecting my teaching skills and working in my field.
