### Introduction 

I was born in Brasil.
I moved to USA years ago where I have been living since then.
Right now I live in Oregon. I am Educational Assistant at High School. 
I have worked in the past in science reserch labs ind different science labs in universities.

I studied undergrad at UC Davis,where I got a B.S. in Genetics.
After that I continued towards my Master in Science in Cell and Molecular Biology at San Francisco State 
University.


I have worked in several research labs.
I am interested in how the our persona or personality arises from living tissue. For me it is interesting 
to know at what point a group of cells start to have life or properties that caracterize as such. When a group of neurons start to produce activity that it is choerent for the system as whole.
Those are questions that I want to reply with my research.
