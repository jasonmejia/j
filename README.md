## Welcome to my website

## Introduction 


I was born in Brasil.
I moved to USA years ago where I have been living since then.
Right now I live in Oregon. I am Educational Assistant at High School. 
I worked in science research labs in universities.

I did my undergrad at UC Davis,where I got a B.S. in Genetics.
After that I continued towards my Master in Science in Cell and Molecular Biology at San Francisco State 
University.


I have worked in several research labs.
I am interested in how our persona ,personality arises from living tissue. I am interested in knowing
 at what point a group of cells start to have life or properties that caracterize such as life, cognition or choerent neural activity starts. When a group of neurons start to produce activity that it is choerent for the system as whole in creating cognition.
Those are questions that I want to reply with my research.
